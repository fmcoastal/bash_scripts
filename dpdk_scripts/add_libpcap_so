cd /root
wget http://www.tcpdump.org/release/libpcap-1.8.1.tar.gz .
tar -zxvf libpcap-1.8.1.tar.gz
cd libpcap-1.8.1
./configure

make install
 
Until now, installation is finished. You may test it with the following code (test.c):

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <pcap.h>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        char *dev, errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

        dev = pcap_lookupdev(errbuf);
        if (dev == NULL) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Couldn't find default device: %s\n", errbuf);
           return(2);
        }
        printf("Device: %s\n", dev);
        return(0);
    }

Commands to compile and execute this program:
$ gcc test.c -lpcap
$ sudo ./a.out
** use sudo to execute the program, because of permission required
Expected output should be like this:
                                                         Device: eth0

One problem you may come across during running the program:

"error while loading shared libraries: libpcap.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

This is because we have installed using .tar.gz, then library is installed in /usr/local/lib directory.

Solution:

Open /etc/ld.so.conf as root, and add the following two lines to it:

/usr/local/lib
/usr/lib

Then execute command:

$ sudo ldconfig

Now compile and run test.c again, and you may get the result.
